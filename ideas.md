# Roadmap/Ideas


## Concrete TODOs

- [x] Youtube link (inline video)
- [ ] Be able to create, list, edit and delete ingredients
- [ ] Be able to create, list, edit and delete recipes

- [ ] Add links to recipe (video or article)
- [ ] Nutritional label for each ingredient (protein, karbs, fat, micronutritiants)
- [ ] Generate shopping lists (add recipe to shopping list)



In the future (when a basic frontend is working):

- Detalied ingredients:
  - Nutritional content per unit
  - |-> which should allow a total nutritional content to be calculated based on it
  - |-> should also be able to sort by e.g. high protein, high fat, high carbs <- could even have the possibility of defining our own rules/categories


- Each recipe should have user-defined tags (healthy, snack, dinner)
- Should be able to create a temporary draft of a recipe to compare how the nutritional content changes when one or more ingredients are changed

- Auto tags, i.e. high protein, fast (under 30min) etc.

- Recipe types: dinner, side dish, salad <- these can be related so that we can choose between different salads for one dinner f.example.



- AI feature that makes you able to ask about what to eat, and the dishes in the application should be used as a basis for answering
- AI feature for asking questions about the dish you are currently looking at
